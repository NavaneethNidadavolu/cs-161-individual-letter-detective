The algorithms/AI schemes
Letter Detective is a multiplayer word-guessing game that uses websockets for real-time player interaction. Both players receive the same random word from a predefined dictionary, competing to guess it faster and earn points. Beware, though â€“ the game only allows a limited number of incorrect guesses. Points are awarded based on the speed of correct guesses and revealed letters. The leaderboard updates in real-time, creating a competitive environment.

Key Features:
Predefined dictionary for diverse words.
Real-time communication through websockets.
Dynamic scoring for speed and accuracy.
Live leaderboard for instant updates.
