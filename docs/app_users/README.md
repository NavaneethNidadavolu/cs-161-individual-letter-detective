# NumRecall App

NumRecall is an app where users can play a number guessing game. The app reveals each digit of a number in random order, and the user has to guess the correct number within 5 attempts. The user can also use hints to reveal a number at a specific position.

To play the game, visit the site [https://numrecall.vercel.app](https://numrecall.vercel.app).

## Homepage

The homepage of the app features two buttons: "Play" and "Leaderboard". 

### Play

By clicking the "Play" button, the user can start playing the game. As the user guesses the number correctly, the level increases, and the number of digits in the number also increases.

### Leaderboard

The "Leaderboard" section displays the top 10 highscores of all players playing the game.

Note: Users can play the game without logging in, but to save their highscore and submit it to the leaderboard, they must be logged in.
